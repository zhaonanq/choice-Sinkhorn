## Replication Instructions

The code for replicating Table 2 in Appendix E.1 can be found in the [notebooks](https://github.com/zhaonanq/choice-Sinkhorn/tree/main/notebooks) folder. Each row of Table 1 corresponds to a distinct dataset, and can be replicated by running the corresponding Jupyter notebook. 

The code for replicating Figure 1 in Appendix E.2 can be found in the [simulations](https://github.com/zhaonanq/choice-Sinkhorn/tree/main/simulations) folder. Figure 1 can be generated by running [getplot.m](https://github.com/zhaonanq/choice-Sinkhorn/blob/main/simulations/getplot.m).
